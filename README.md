# PersonalPaint
Just my own take on windows paint program!
Currently in progress for further Development.
Currently draws circles depending on coordinates, implemented mouse handlers to determine drawing(drag release etc)
Has colours that can use by preset colours with dropdown or it can have custom RGB values with a nice interface for users to use
Next steps are:
Create eraser
Create Different shapes that can be used as drawings (squares, triangles etc)
Create textures (crayon, thin marker, thick marker)
